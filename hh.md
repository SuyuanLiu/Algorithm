- discussion lacked the model interpretability，可解释性
- 非跨人实验，怎样避免 overfitting
- graphic attention model trained by channel-wise? For each channel, one graphic attention network and one LSTM were trained? 
- 细节不清楚，无法复现
- abstract可以改改，can be improved to be easier to understand what was done.
- introduction介绍了太多概念，confusing
- related work要讨论一下那些工作的优缺点
- 最后总结为什么你的模型好，有什么缺陷
- two branch怎么体现作用的
- 语法错误

-----------------
**Fixed**
- 为什么Hjorth and HOC在跨人实验效果好，但非跨人不好
- unclear how to construct the graph using EEG features as the input of SGA-LSTM
